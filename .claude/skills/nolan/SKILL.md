  Orientation + router for working on the NOLAN codebase (turns essays/artworks into
  narrated videos). Read this FIRST on any non-trivial NOLAN task — it maps the two flows,
  the skill registry, every subsystem + where it lives, the key commands, and the
  cross-cutting runtime gotchas that repeatedly bite (Windows-python-from-WSL, the GPU lock,
  the shared-working-tree/git-index hazard with concurrent agents, the numpy/Pillow pins).
  It is a MAP that points into the code + skills/ registry — it does not duplicate them.
  Use when: starting to explore NOLAN, unsure which subsystem/skill owns a task, or hitting
  an environment/build error.

# NOLAN — the map

NOLAN turns a source (markdown essay, paper, or artwork) into a narrated video: script →
scene plan → assets (library / stock / ComfyUI-gen / cutouts) → render (Remotion) → assemble.

**This file orients; it doesn't contain the rules.** Rules live in `CLAUDE.md`. Durable facts
live in memory (`MEMORY.md`). Pipeline judgment prose lives in `skills/<domain>/*.md`. This is
the index that ties them together — read the pointed-to file for detail.

## The two flows

Both pick one **theme** and run a source through gates: **Gate A** = plan-time HITL (authoring),
**Gate B** = render-time HITL (per-beat edits).

- **explainer** — idea-dense text → narrated explainer; visuals stand in for abstract ideas.
  Skill: `skills/explainer/flow.md` (+ `script.md`, `scene-grammar.md`, `block-catalog.md`).
- **art** — image-first; the artwork IS the subject; narration interprets it (Ken Burns /
  spotlight / callouts). Skill: `skills/art/flow.md`.
- Engine: `src/nolan/flows/` (`explainer.py`, `art.py`, `authoring.py`, `edit.py`, `ingest.py`,
  `gate/`). CLI: `nolan render-flow <project>`.

## The skill system (how to find the right prose)

A **skill** = any `.md` with an `id:` in frontmatter. Two roots, one catalog:
- `skills/<domain>/*.md` — pipeline judgment prose, injected at gates via
  `handoff(skill_id)` (`src/nolan/skills/__init__.py`). Domains: `common` (cross-flow craft),
  `explainer`, `art`, `flow`, `orchestrator` (one-shot prompts), `publish`.
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — harness-invocable Claude Code skills (this one;
  `nolan-scene-edit`; `beautiful-article`). Cataloged in place — **moving breaks invocation.**
- Catalog: `skills/index.json`. Lint/regenerate: `python -m nolan.skills`. Browse: `/skills`
  hub page (Registry / Lineage / Health). `kind` ∈ {contract, craft, grammar, prompt, methodology}.

→ To change *how the pipeline reasons* at a stage, edit the skill in `skills/<domain>/`, not code.

## Runtime gotchas (these cost hours if unknown)

- **Python is the Windows env**, even from WSL: `D:\env\nolan\python.exe` (WSL:
  `/mnt/d/env/nolan/python.exe`), pip `D:\env\nolan\Scripts\pip.exe`. Run with `-X utf8` on
  Windows or ffmpeg cp1252 decode crashes corrupt scene detection.
- **Rendering needs Windows node**: WSL `node` can't build (esbuild binary is win32) — use
  `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe`. Bundled ffmpeg: `render-service/node_modules/@ffmpeg-installer`.
- **GPU lock**: ComfyUI + OmniVoice TTS serialize on `get_gpu_lock()`. Prefer CPU work
  (e.g. rembg cutout) so it doesn't queue behind renders/TTS.
- **Dependency pins**: keep `numpy<2.3` + `Pillow<12` (opencv/moviepy need them). rembg is the
  optional `[cutout]` extra, pinned `<2.0.76` to stay numpy<2.3-compatible.
- **Concurrent agents share ONE working tree + git index** (tmux agents). The branch can change
  under you; the index can carry another agent's staged files. **Commit with an explicit
  pathspec** (`git commit -m "…" -- <your files>`) and land on master via an **isolated worktree
  cherry-pick** — never a whole-branch fast-forward (it publishes others' WIP).
- **Hub**: port **8011** (avoid 8001 — SPARTA). Tailnet via `tailscale serve --tcp=8011`.
- **UI screenshots**: Windows Chrome headless, or puppeteer (`render-service/node_modules`) for
  device-emulated (iPhone) viewports — Chrome `--window-size` won't honor <484px CSS width.

## Where knowledge lives (keep these distinct)

- `CLAUDE.md` — **rules & conventions** you must follow.
- memory (`MEMORY.md` + files) — **durable facts** across sessions (verify paths before acting).
- `skills/<domain>/*.md` — **pipeline judgment prose** (via `handoff()`), tracked in the registry.
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — **invocable** Claude Code skills.
- **this file** — the **map/router**. Add pointers here; put detail in the right place above.

## Conventions

- **Language layering** (don't flatten to all-English): code/ids/keys/`tags`/`mood` = English;
  product pairs = `x` + `xZh`; audience free-text (`bestFor`, narration) = Chinese; engine docs
  (`IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS`, comments) = English; skill agent-docs = Chinese, consistent per file.
- After a feature, update `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (CLAUDE.md rule).
