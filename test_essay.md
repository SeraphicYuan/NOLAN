# The Rise and Fall of Venezuela

## Introduction

Venezuela was once the richest country in South America. With the world's largest proven oil reserves, the nation seemed destined for prosperity. Oil revenues funded massive social programs that lifted millions out of poverty.

## The Crisis

But when global oil prices crashed in 2014, everything changed. The economy collapsed almost overnight. Hyperinflation destroyed the currency. Store shelves emptied. Millions fled the country in search of food and medicine.

## Conclusion

Today, Venezuela serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of depending on a single commodity. Economic diversification isn't just good policy - it's survival.
