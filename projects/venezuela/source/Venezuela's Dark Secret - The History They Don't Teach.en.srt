00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,560
welcome back to world history explored

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,360
today we will talk about Venezuela's

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,800
history which is often Tangled in blame

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,040
some say socialism ruined everything

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,400
others point to a harsh dictator who

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,520
devastated the poor and some highlight

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,640
the country's overdependence on oil by

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,240
now you've likely come across various

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,279
reasons for Venezuela's crisis each

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,640
colored by the speaker political stance

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,560
the truth is the situation is the result

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,559
of many complex factors

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,520
and it's hard to get a clear picture

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,440
because people often use the crisis to

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,200
push their own agendas so we dove into

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,600
the internet and consulted some

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,920
impartial researchers to uncover what

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,399
really went wrong in Venezuela's

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,160
history the history of Venezuela is

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,280
deeply rooted in its ancient past

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,320
archaeologists have uncovered evidence

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,280
of the earliest known inhabitants of the

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,000
region through leaf-shaped flake tools

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,680
and other implements found on the high

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,960
river Terraces of the pedral river in

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,960
Western Venezuela these artifacts dating

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,080
from 15,000 to 9,000 years BP include

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,680
spear tips from a site in Northwestern

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,520
Venezuela known as El Jobo other notable

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,159
sites such as Tama yellow muo and El

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,079
Jobo in Falone have also provided

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,240
insights into these early societies

33
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,799
these early inhabitants coexisted with

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,000
megap like megaterium glyptodon and

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,439
toxodon

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,960
around 9,000 to 7,000 years BP during

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,240
the meso Indian period these early

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
hunters and gatherers began shifting to

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,320
other food sources and establishing the

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,600

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,719
flourished in present day Merida

Venezuela the complexity of

44
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,240
pre-colombian societies was

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,600
evident the timoto kuika were known for

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,719
their well-planned permanent Villages

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,520
surrounded by irrigated fields and

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,960
equipped with water storage tanks their

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,239
houses were constructed from Stone and

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,800
wood with thatched roofs and they

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,959
practiced peaceful agriculture growing

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,080
crops like potatoes and

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,560
ulcos they also left behind works of art

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,160
including anthropomorphic Ceramics and

near the or noo Delta and landed in the

60
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,879
Gulf of paria he was blown away by a

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,239
massive flow of fresh water that pushed

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,519
him off course and wrote to Isabella and

63
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,519
Ferdinand saying he felt like he had

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,840
found heaven on Earth he marveled at how

65
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,040
such a huge amount of fresh water was so

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,319
close to saltwater and he thought it was

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,440
either a sign of paradise or an

68
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,560
Incredible Discovery since he'd never

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,360
seen anything like it

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,720
before karacas founded in 1567 in the

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
central coastal region became a key

72
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,239
location due to its proximity to the

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,560
port of lagara its defensible position

74
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,879
in a mountain valley and its fertile

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,000
healthy climate by the late 18th century

76
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,840
some Venezuelans started resisting

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,080
colonial rule Spain's neglect of its

78
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,440
Venezuelan Colony sparked a growing

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,599
interest in learning among Venezuelan

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,159
intellectuals unlike other Spanish

81
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,760
territories Venezuela had more external

82
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:32,920
sources of information though only the

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,200
Manos Venezuelan Creole Elites had

84
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,760
access to good

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,200
education the Manos also known as gr

86
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,439
kaca because of their wealth were seen

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,439
as arrogant and insistent on maintaining

88
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,400
their privileges over the mixed race

89
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,599
Paro majority the term mantuanos is

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
still used in Venezuela to describe

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
someone who is

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,239
pretentious the first organized attempt

93
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,319
to overthrow colonial rule in Venezuela

94
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,519
happened in

95
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:04,159
1797 led by Manuel Gul and Jose Maria

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,519
espa inspired directly by the French

97
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,519
Revolution their movement was crushed

98
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,400
with the help of the mantuanos because

99
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,760
it pushed for drastic social changes

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,160
Francisco de Miranda a hero of the

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,160
French Revolution is closely linked with

102
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,799
the fight for independence in Latin

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,600
America he dreamed of an independent

104
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,000
Empire that would unite all the

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,320
territories formally under Spanish and

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,919
Portuguese control stretching from the

107
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,960
Mississippi River to Cape Horn he

108
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,520
imagined this empire being led by a

109
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,840
hereditary Emperor called the Inca as a

110
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,800
tribute to the great Inca Empire and

111
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,919
governed by a byic Camal legislature

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Miranda also proposed the name Colombia

113
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,080
for this Empire after the Explorer

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,400
Christopher

115
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,800
Columbus with some informal help from

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,560
the British general Miranda attempted to

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,160
invade the captain SE general of

118
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Venezuela in

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,759
1804 Britain was at war with Spain which

120
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,759
was Allied with Napoleon at the time in

121
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,680
November 1805 Miranda went to New York

122
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,320
and began secretly organizing a

123
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,560
filibustering expedition to liberate

124
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,120
Venezuela he hired a ship with 20 guns

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,520
renamed it Leander after his eldest son

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
and set sail for Venezuela on February

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,240
2nd

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,759
1806 however his attempt to land in okar

129
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
De La Costa was

130
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,280
unsuccessful Miranda spent the following

131
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,120
year in the British Caribbean waiting

132
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,639
for reinforcements that never arrived

133
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
when he returned return to Britain he

134
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,400
found more support for his plans from

135
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,520
the British government in 1808 a large

136
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,080
military force was assembled to attack

137
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,199
Venezuela led by Arthur Welsley

138
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,680
however when Napoleon invaded Spain the

139
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,720
situation changed turning Spain into a

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,800
British Ally as a result the force was

141
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,960
redirected to fight in the Peninsular

142
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,360
War

143
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
instead events in Europe played a key

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,639
role in leading to Venezuela's

145
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,319
Declaration of Independence the nap

146
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,840
aonic Wars weakened Spain's control over

147
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,759
its Empire and unofficially put Britain

148
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,960
on the side of the independence movement

149
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,800
in May 1808 Napoleon forced Ferdinand

150
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,800
iith of Spain to abdicate along with his

151
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,280
father Charles IV Napoleon then

152
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,280
installed his brother Joseph bonapart as

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,000
king of Spain this sparked Spain's own

154
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,319
War of Independence against French rule

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,560
even before the Spanish-American Wars of

156
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,639
Independence

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,120
began in response the Spanish resistance

158
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,000
formed the Supreme Central Yuna to

159
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,360
govern in the name of Ferdinand iith the

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,440
first significant defeat for Napoleonic

161
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,759
France came at the Battle of balen in

162
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,479
Andalusia in July 1808 where future

163
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,560
figures like Pablo Moro emerio urenia

164
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:55,639
and Jose Des San Martin fought against

165
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,759
French General Pier dupon despite this

166
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,919
Victory the French soon regained the

167
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,479
upper hand and advanced into southern

168
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,599
Spain forcing the Spanish government to

169
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,879
retreat to kadis there the Supreme

170
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,120
Central Yun dissolved itself and

171
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,479
established a five-person Regency to

172
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,199
manage the state until the full Cortez

173
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,919
of kadis could be

converted news of the events soon

175
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,720
reached karakas but it wasn't until

176
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:26,280
April 19th 1810 that the city's Council

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,479
or cabildo decided to follow the example

178
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,919
of the Spanish provinces from 2 years

179
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,919
earlier by declaring the First Republic

180
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,479

barinas and truo quickly did the same

184
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,400
the newly formed yunta suprema de

185
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,919
karakas was made up of self-appointed

186
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,319
elite members who claim to represent the

187
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,039
paros free blacks and even slaves

188
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,520
however the new government struggled to

189
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,440
