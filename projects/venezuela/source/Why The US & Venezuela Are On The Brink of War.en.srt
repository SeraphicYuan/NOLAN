1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
Something unprecedented is taking place

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,279
right now in the Caribbean Sea. The

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,960
United States is currently deploying

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,800
more military assets to this theater

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
than at any other point in the 21st

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,320
century, and it's the largest

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,759
concentration of US military might in

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,480
the Western Hemisphere since the

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,560
country's invasion of Panama in 1989.

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
This time, however, the US military is

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
concentrating its forces just outside of

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,560
the territorial waters of Venezuela,

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,480
arguably the most antagonistic country

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,720
in the Western Hemisphere to American

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
interests. The US has deployed three

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,440
modern Arlayberg class guided missile

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,600
destroyers and one ticeroga class guided

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
missile cruiser along with at least one

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
nuclearpowered attack submarine just

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
offshore of Venezuela that all

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,200
collectively carry a strike package of

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,440
dozens to hundreds of Tomahawk cruise

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
missiles. If these Navy warships weren't

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,520
enough, they've also been joined by the

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,039
22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit as well,

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,199
consisting of the amphibious assault

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
ship USS Emojima along with its

28
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,600
complement of two transport and

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,120
logistical support ships. The USS Eojima

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
in particular is basically a

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,559
miniaturized aircraft carrier that was

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,640
captured by photographs on its way to

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,119
Venezuela with multiple Harrier attack

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,200
aircraft M22 Osprey assault helicopters

35
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,680
and Sakorski heavy lift helicopters all

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
on board. It can also along with its two

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
transport and logistical support ships

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
launch multiple hovercraft and

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
amphibious assault vehicles for armed

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
beach assaults under its aerial coverage

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,159
too. More than 2500 US Marines have been

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,320
deployed here with the 22nd. Along with

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
around 2,000 sailors belonging to the

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
naval complement with the destroyers,

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,520
the cruiser, and the submarine. And on

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,439
top of all of this firepower, the US has

47
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,000
also deployed a literal combat ship to

48
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,000
the theater as well. The USS Minneapolis

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
St. Paul, bringing the total number of

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
vessels deployed in the theater so far,

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,320
up to nine, while at least an additional

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,399
10 F-35 fighter jets have also been

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,159
deployed to airfields in Puerto Rico.

54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,680
The Trump administration's officially

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,520
stated purpose for deploying all of

56
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
these assets nearby to Venezuela right

57
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,600
now is to simply conduct counternarics

58
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,520
operations and to halt the flow of drugs

59
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,439
from Venezuela coming into the United

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,040
States. But deploying warships and

61
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,880
nuclearpowered submarines armed with

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
tomahawk cruise missiles, Harrier

63
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,759
aircraft, F-35 fighters, and thousands

64
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,319
of Marines ready for a beach assault

65
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,160
appears to be wildly overkill for that

66
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,840
kind of a mission alone against drug

67
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,400
runners who most often use nothing more

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
advanced than motorized speedboats. Most

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
drugs enter into the United States today

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,360
through the Pacific coast anyway, while

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,440
a great deal more come in through air

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
shipments. None of which the flotillaa

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,640
being assembled off the coast of

74
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
Venezuela will be capable of stopping,

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,560
which has led to rampant speculation

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
that their ulterior objective may be

77
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
attempting to induce regime change

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,760
within Venezuela instead. By

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
overthrowing their president, Nicholas

80
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,080
Maduro, merely weeks before this

81
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
flotilla began being assembled, the US

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,239
government doubled the bounty it had

83
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,680
placed on Maduro's head from $25 million

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,280
to an unprecedented $50 million. the

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,200
biggest bounty that the US government

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
has ever put on a single individual's

87
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,920
head in history. To put how serious this

88
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
$50 million bounty recently placed on

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
Nicholas Maduro is in comparison, it's

90
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,159
double the bounty that the US has put on

91
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,480
other previous men on its most wanted

92
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,640
lists like Osama bin Laden, Saddam

93
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,879
Hussein, and the former leader of ISIS,

94
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,040
Abu Baky Albagghdaddy. All of whom

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,239
topped out on the US bounty list at just

96
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,400
$25 million by comparison. The US bounty

97
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
on Nicholas Maduro today is what it once

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
had placed on both Osama bin Laden and

99
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,319
Saddam Hussein together. And the US

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
doesn't recognize him as Venezuela's

101
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,400
legitimate president either. And Maduro

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
himself is far from the only man in

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
Venezuela with a high US bounty on his

104
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
head. His appointed Minister of the

105
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,599
Interior, Diastano Cababo Randon, now

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,159
has a $25 million bounty placed on his

107
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,080
head as well, equaling Osama bin Laden's

108
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,799
bounty. His defense minister, General

109
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,799
Vladimir Padrino Lopez, has a $15

110
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,360
million bounty, while his minister of

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,760
industry, Tariq Zidon Isami Madawa, has

112
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,080
another $10 million bounty, collectively

113
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,840
representing $100 million worth of

114
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,440
bounties placed on just these four

115
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
senior leaders of the Venezuelan

116
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,640
government alone. In July, the month

117
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,720
before all of these bounties were

118
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,480
dramatically increased, US President

119
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,239
Donald Trump signed a secret directive

120
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,000
that authorized the US military to

121
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
deploy force against Latin American

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,519
cartels that were designated by his

123
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,439
government as terrorist organizations,

124
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
which includes Venezuela's most infamous

125
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,239
criminal organization, Trenagua. This

126
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,239
secret directive has once again raised

127
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,000
the spectre of a 21st century

128
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,000
interpretation of America's Monroe

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
Doctrine, its historical justification

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
for militarily intervening in the

131
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
affairs of other states in the Americas.

132
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,520
The Trump administration accuses Maduro

133
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280
and his close inner circle of secretly

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
running their own drunk cartel called

135
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,120
the cartel of the Sons which the Trump

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,800
administration further accuses of

137
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
providing material support to both

138
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
Trenaragua and the Sinaloa cartel in

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
Mexico their cocaine and fentinel

140
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
running operations into the United

141
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,160
States. Thus, the Trump administration

142
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,840
has led the US into designating the

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,759
cartel of the Suns as a terrorist

144
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,360
organization as well, which is the

145
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
justification that the US government has

146
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
used to label Maduro and his inner

147
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,360
circle as narot terrorists and to place

148
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
massive bounties on their heads with.

149
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
And it might also become the cautious

150
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,479
belli that they use to initiate attacks

151
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
on the Maduro government from the

152
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,240
flotillaa that's being assembled off of

153
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
their shores. It should also be noted

154
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
that there are many, many controversies

155
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
surrounding the cartel of the suns,

156
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
including as to whether or not it even

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,160
exists. Argentina, Paraguay, Peru,

158
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,520
Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic have

159
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,360
all joined the United States and

160
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
declared the Cartel of the Suns to be a

161
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,199
terrorist organization. Maduro himself

162
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,280
denies that any such organization

163
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,440
exists. While Colombia's leftist

164
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
president, Gustavo Pro, has also

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
publicly rejected the cartel's existence

166
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,280
and has insisted that it's nothing more

167
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
than a propaganda tool being used to

168
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,919
justify toppling Venezuela's government.

169
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Several internal reports in the US also

170
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,000
seem to contradict many of the Trump

171
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,440
administration's claims here. In May, a

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
National Intelligence Council report

173
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,199
that was declassified concluded that the

174
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
Maduro government likely didn't have any

175
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,680
policy of cooperating with Treneragua,

176
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
nor did it direct any of Trenderwa's

177
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,440
operations in the United States.

178
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,039
Similarly, the Mexican government has

179
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,479
also said that they have never found any

180
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,479
link between Maduro's government in

181
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,039
Venezuela and the Sinaloa cartel in

182
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,880
Mexico. Nonetheless, the justifications

183
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,360
and cases bellies have been drafted and

184
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,120
the firepower put into place. All that's

185
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
required now is to simply pull the

186
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
trigger. And on the 2nd of September,

187
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,479
the first shots were fired. A boat

188
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,319
carrying 11 Venezuelans in international

189
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,240
waters that had departed from Venezuela,

190
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,880
was shot by a missile, likely fired by

191
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,800
an American MQ9 Reaper drone, killing

192
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,240
everyone on board. The US government

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
claimed afterwards that the boat was

194
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,199
carrying a large amount of drugs and

195
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,360
that everyone on board were members of

196
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,600
Trend Neragua, potentially representing

197
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,960
the first instance of a lethal US drone

198
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
strike conducted against a Latin

199
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,960
American cartel since Trump returned

200
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
back to the presidency. This operation

201
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,880
sharply contrasts with the traditional

202
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
procedures the US has used against drug

203
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,639
running vessels in the past, which are

204
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
typically intercepted by the Coast Guard

205
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
and raided so that their contents can be

206
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
verified and their crews apprehended.

207
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,919
Blowing up a suspected drug running

208
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,840
vessel with a drone strike isn't

209
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,759
something that's happened until now, and

210
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
it's only added on to the escalation

211
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
going on around Venezuela. Since the

212
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,199
Trump administration accuses Maduro's

213
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,919
government of directly maintaining links

214
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,160
to Trend Naragua, adding even more fuel

215
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
to the fire, CNN has also begun

216
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,680
reporting that according to multiple

217
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,440
inside sources, the Trump administration

218
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
is presently considering initiating

219
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,000
military strikes against cartel targets

220
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,479
within Venezuela itself, which could

221
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
ostensibly mean strikes against Trenanga

222
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,759
or against the Venezuelan government

223
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,680
itself, which the Trump administration

224
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,000
claims is essentially indistinguishable

225
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
from a cartel. Maduro himself seems to

226
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
believe that the US flotillaa gathering

227
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,199
off of his shores are indeed preparing

228
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,280
to attack him and to remove him from

229
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,880
power. He has been freaking out on

230
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,479
social media and in speeches about the

231
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,479
prospect. Has ordered a full

232
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,240
mobilization of his military. Has called

233
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,000
for millions of additional Venezuelan

234
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
citizens to join the country's armed

235
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,080
militias to resist any attack. Has

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
deployed at least 15,000 of his troops

237
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,319
to the border with Colombia. And has

238
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
sworn to resist and fight the US to the

239
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,479
bitter end in the event of an actual

240
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,879
attack. On the 5th of September, a pair

241
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,800
of Venezuelan F-16 fighters flew close

242
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,039
to the American warships in a show of

243
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,879
resolve, and the US warned that they

244
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,800
could be shot down the next time if they

245
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,720
were deemed to be a threat. It's really

246
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
not an exaggeration at all to say that

247
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,479
the United States and Venezuela have

248
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
never been closer to the brink of war

249
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,800
than they currently are now. So, what

250
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
exactly is going on here? How did the US

251
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
and Venezuela get to this point? What

252
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
are the risks of actual conflict both

253
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,919
now and in the future? and will we end

254
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,720
up getting the world we played in during

255
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,240
Mercenaries 2 back in the late 2000s?

256
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,160
It's been building up towards this for

257
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
quite some time because the US and

258
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
Venezuela have maintained a very

259
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,519
adversarial relationship for pretty much

260
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
my own entire lifetime. To give some

261
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,279
historical recap, Venezuela should

262
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,959
realistically be a global energy

263
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,959
superpower because it controls the

264
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,279
largest proven reserves of oil on the

265
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,959
planet, more than even Saudi Arabia. The

266
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,800
oil in Venezuela used to provide the

267
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,360
country with fabulous riches. And as

268
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,519
recently as the 1970s, Venezuela had the

269
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,680
highest GDP per capita in Latin America

270
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
because of it. But Venezuela's crude oil

271
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,839
is heavy, sour, and full of impurities

272
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,920
like sulfur. Which means that it's

273
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
pretty difficult to refine. Venezuela

274
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
was able to gain the technical

275
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
assistance it needed with drilling and

276
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,560
refining by attracting major foreign oil

277
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,320
companies like Exxon Mobile, Konico

278
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Phillips, Chevron, and Shell to the

279
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,640
country through joint ventures with

280
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,720
Venezuela stateowned oil company PDVSA.

281
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,480
Oil profits were split 60/40 between

282
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,880
government owned PDVSA and the foreign

283
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,640
energy companies. PDVSA gained valuable

284
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,240
foreign experience and the economic

285
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,320
relationship with the United States

286
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,320
blossomed. And due to the geographic

287
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
proximity of the US to Venezuela,

288
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,080
American energy companies built up a

289
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,920
dense network of heavyduty oil

290
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
refineries across the Gulf Coast in

291
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,480
Texas and Louisiana that could handle

292
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,800
refining Venezuela's nearby extra heavy

293
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
crude, which increased the US Venezuela

294
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,399
relationship even further. By the late

295
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,640
1990s, an overwhelming 60 to 70% of

296
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,800
Venezuela's oil exports were all heading

297
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,760
to the United States, while Venezuelan

298
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,320
oil made up about 15% of all US oil

299
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,320
imports. The single largest source from

300
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
any country in the world at the time.

301
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,000
But the huge amount of money that was

302
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,399
gushing into Venezuela through the oil

303
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,640
industry gave way to runaway corruption,

304
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,360
mismanagement, and overdependence.

305
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,760
Between 1972 and 1997, it's been

306
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,600
estimated that as much as $100 billion

307
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,600
dollars was simply embezzled in the

308
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,920
country by hopelessly corrupt government

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
officials. Meanwhile, oil came to make

310
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,120
up a whopping 90% of Venezuela's total

311
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,959
exports, as much as 70% of the

312
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,839
government's operating budget and up to

313
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,040
40% of the country's entire GDP,

314
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,640
crowding out the development of

315
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,880
virtually all other industries in the

316
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,600
country. In the 1980s, the price of oil

317
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,959
crashed from about $40 a barrel in 1979

318
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,120
to just $10 to $12 a barrel by 1986,

319
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,279
which severely hurt the undiversified

320
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
Venezuelan economy. Inflation and debt

321
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,839
in the country both began to soar to

322
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
unsustainable levels. And in 1989, the

323
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,279
government agreed to the terms of a

324
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,600
financial bailout from the IMF that

325
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,600
included steep fiscal austerity measures

326
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,760
like decreased subsidies, public sector

327
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,000
layoffs, a currency devaluation, and

328
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,680
increased taxes and interest rates.

329
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,279
Enraged by the fact that the corrupt

330
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
government had embezzled billions of

331
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,320
dollars through the stateowned oil

332
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,839
industry and then left its own people to

333
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
suffer the consequences through these

334
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
austerity measures. The results sparked

335
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,600
a wave of deadly riots across the

336
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,920
country in a sharp increase in

337
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,760
anti-government sentiment. Rioting on

338
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,680
this wave of revolt, a revolutionary

339
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,959
named Hugo Chavez attempted to launch a

340
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
failed coup attempt against the

341
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,040
government in 1992. briefly found

342
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,680
himself in prison and then eventually

343
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,760
emerged victorious in the country's 1998

344
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,839
presidential election after running on

345
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,760
an explicitly socialist political

346
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,600
platform with promises that he would

347
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,959
redistribute the nation's oil wealth in

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,519
order to help reduce poverty and

349
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,279
inequality. And so began the socialist

350
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,680
experiment in Venezuela that has lasted

351
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,920
for decades ever since. Chavez's

352
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
policies, at least initially, actually

353
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,760
were quite successful at reducing the

354
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,519
country's poverty rate. But they also

355
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
set in motion the chain of events that

356
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,040
would eventually lead to Venezuela's

357
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,279
almost complete and catastrophic

358
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,880
collapse. Oil production in Venezuela

359
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,640
peaked under his wash in the early

360
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,959
2000s. But after workers at the

361
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,600
stateowned oil company PDVSA began

362
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,040
striking in 2002, he simply fired

363
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,800
thousands of the company's most

364
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,720
experienced workers in the industry

365
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,560
rather than giving into their demands,

366
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,000
which eliminated a huge amount of the

367
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,320
country's technical expertise and

368
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,560
knowhow. He also took steps to almost

369
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
completely nationalize the entire oil

370
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,839
industry in the country through seizures

371
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,760
of assets that were owned by the foreign

372
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,240
oil companies like Exxon Chevron and

373
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Konico Phillips which began greatly

374
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
straining Venezuela's relationship with

375
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,959
the United States and led to

376
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
dramatically reduced foreign investment

377
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,800
in the country which hurt Venezuela's

378
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
ability to keep their own refineries and

379
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
operations running in the long term. At

380
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,800
almost the same time, he also began

381
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
providing heavily subsidized Venezuelan

382
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,959
oil to friendly, largely fellow leftist

383
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,279
states in the region as well, like Cuba

384
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,519
and Nicaragua, which further drain the

385
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,920
country's remaining strategic reserves.

386
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,639
Within just 15 years after being elected

387
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,639
by 2013, Chavez oversaw the country's

388
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
national debt more than double while

389
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,480
watching their strategic reserves of oil

390
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,800
dwindle and dwindle. It was an

391
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,720
unsustainable system, but it was also a

392
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
popular one that enabled Chavez to

393
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,120
steadily expand the powers of his office

394
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,959
to near dictatorial levels. He

395
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,399
eliminated presidential term limits, and

396
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,639
he had multiple independent media

397
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,200
outlets harassed or even shut down. When

398
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,880
he died in office in 2013, Chavez's

399
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
right-hand man and vice president,

400
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,560
Nicholas Maduro, took over the

401
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,480
presidency after him, and he took the

402
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,120
opportunity to rapidly coales his

403
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,600
position into a fullblown dictatorship.

404
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,440
In 2014, just the year after he took

405
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
things over, the global price of oil

406
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,760
collapsed again from more than $100 a

407
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,560
barrel to less than $30 a barrel by

408
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,000
early 2016, which threw the Venezuelan

409
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,320
economy that was still cripplingly

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,160
overdependent on oil into a tail spin.

411
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,680
Chavez's generous social welfare

412
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
policies and subsidies that made him

413
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,360
hugely popular with the people only

414
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,440
worked so long as the price of oil

415
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,279
remained high and Venezuela made lots of

416
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,279
money. Once the oil price collapsed

417
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,279
under Maduro, the nation could no longer

418
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,839
afford its lavish Chavez era

419
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,920
expenditures. Protests and riots erupted

420
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,920
across the country as services and jobs

421
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,079
were dramatically cut and inflation

422
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,160
skyrocketed, to which Maduro responded

423
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,240
to with violence and crackdowns that

424
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,240
immediately diminished his popularity.

425
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
In 2015, the Obama administration

426
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,240
declared Venezuela a national security

427
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
threat and authorized targeted sanctions

428
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
against Maduro and other government

429
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
officials. But the true avalanche of

430
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,760
sanctions and the shattering of US

431
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,680
Venezuela relations would come later

432
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,519
during the first Trump administration.

433
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199
As the political and economic crisis in

434
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,440
Venezuela deepened and Maduro grew

435
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,199
increasingly more autocratic, the first

436
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Trump administration steadily came to

437
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,519
embrace a policy of maximum pressure

438
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
against Maduro in an attempt to force

439
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,920
his removal from office through economic

440
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,160
means, especially after the controversy

441
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,000
of the 2018 election in the country.

442
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,320
That year, Maduro claimed to have won

443
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,079
re-election to a second six-year term as

444
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,320
president in an election that was widely

445
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,760
marred by irregularities, the banning of

446
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
major opposition candidates from

447
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,079
running, rock bottom turnout, and

448
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,519
accusations of fraud. All of Maduro's

449
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,680
political opponents who ran against him

450
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,079
refused to recognize the 2018 elections

451
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,000
results, as did the US, Australia, the

452
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,560
Organization of American States, and the

453
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,399
EU. At the same time, many of Maduro's

454
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,800
international allies chose to support

455
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,880
him and recognize the results, including

456
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Cuba, Nicaragua, Russia, Bellaris,

457
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,959
China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, and

458
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,959
Turkey, setting the stage for Venezuela

459
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,040
becoming a flash point in the new 21st

460
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,880
century cold war. The first Trump

461
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,720
administration refused to recognize the

462
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
election and first declared Maduro to be

463
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,680
an illegitimate usurper when his second

464
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,680
term began in January of 2019. The US

465
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,199
recognized Juan Guyaido, the head of the

466
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
country's opposition control national

467
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,279
assembly, as the interim president of

468
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,199
Venezuela instead, severed its remaining

469
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,880
diplomatic relations with Venezuela, and

470
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,959
expelled the country's diplomats from

471
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,480
Washington. Long-standing relations that

472
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,399
had lasted for decades and had been

473
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,000
strained for years were finally

474
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,079
shattered to the point of open

475
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,160
hostility. And on top of all of that,

476
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,560
Trump led the US into unleashing an

477
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,079
avalanche of new sanctions on Venezuela,

478
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,480
too, that were designed to try and

479
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,079
encourage Maduro's removal. Venezuela's

480
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
remaining access to the US financial

481
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,360
system was eliminated, which made it

482
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,759
much more difficult for the country to

483
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,279
borrow money and refinance debt. Other

484
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
sanctions were designed to target and

485
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,519
strangle the Venezuelan oil industry. US

486
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,279
companies were completely prohibited

487
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,880
from purchasing Venezuelan oil, while

488
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,079
further sanctions targeted companies

489
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,160
that were involved in transporting

490
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,160
Venezuelan oil to third party countries

491
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,079
as well. This eliminated Venezuela's

492
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,000
ability to access the heavyduty oil

493
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,759
refineries around the US Gulf Coast that

494
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
they had used for decades to refine

495
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,519
their oil at, while further sanctions

496
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,040
block spare parts and chemicals from

497
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,639
entering into Venezuela to prevent them

498
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,639
from adequately maintaining their own

499
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,320
refineries as well. Coupled with their

500
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,160
own self-induced brain drain of

501
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
experienced oil workers fired during the

502
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,440
Chavez years and decades of

503
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,279
mismanagement, underinvestment, and

504
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,519
corruption. The sanctions helped cause

505
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,680
Venezuela's oil production to completely

506
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,079
collapse. And with it, so too did

507
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,920
Venezuela's economy. After 2015,

508
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,920
Venezuelan oil production began falling

509
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,240
off a cliff as the sanctions began to

510
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,160
bite to the point where today Venezuela

511
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,880
is producing less oil than it was back

512
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,959
during World War II. Despite having the

513
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,600
largest reserves in the world between

514
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,679
2014 and 2021 under Maduro's government,

515
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,799
the Venezuelan economy collapsed by an

516
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,799
almost unbelievable three4s. One of the

517
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,799
most catastrophic economic collapses

518
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,439
that has ever been witnessed in modern

519
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,559
history. hyperinflation set in and grew

520
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,439
to as high as 130,000%

521
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,600
by 2018, making the Venezuelan currency

522
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,520
almost worthless in the process. And

523
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,880
while inflation has slowed down since

524
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,679
then, it was still sitting at 190% as

525
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,520
recently as 2023. All of these issues

526
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,200
collectively plunged Venezuela into what

527
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
has probably been the country's greatest

528
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,520
civilizational crisis in its entire

529
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,679
history. basic goods and services,

530
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,760
including food, water, and gasoline, all

531
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,480
became preciously scarce. And by late

532
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,080
2022, more than half of Venezuela's

533
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,559
population were reduced to living in

534
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,640
poverty. By far the highest percentage

535
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,640
seen on the South American continent.

536
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,640
And all of this was explicitly designed

537
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
to destroy Maduro's popularity and

538
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,640
undermine his legitimacy within

539
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,200
Venezuela and hopefully lead to his

540
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,280
removal from within. But ironically, the

541
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,880
sanctions that Trump dumped on Venezuela

542
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,120
during his first term contributed

543
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,520
directly to the country's unprecedented

544
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,120
migration crisis later during the Biden

545
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,360
administration that he would use as an

546
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,200
issue to help get himself reelected in

547
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,120
2024. Since 2014, close to 8 million

548
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,360
Venezuelan refugees are believed to have

549
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,200
fled the country all around the world,

550
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,000
with many of them heading north towards

551
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,160
the US southern border. By 2021, shortly

552
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,280
after Trump had left office, Venezuelans

553
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,880
became the second most common

554
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
nationality, arriving at the southern

555
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,320
border, remaining only behind Mexicans.

556
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,080
And by 2023, the numbers of undocumented

557
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,919
Venezuelan migrants residing in the

558
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,720
United States had increased by nearly

559
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,039
10fold from 2019, around when the heavy

560
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,960
sanctions were first imposed. From only

561
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:55,919
around 64,000 then, to around 650,000

562
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,600
by 2023. Even worse, for the first Trump

563
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
administration, the sanctions didn't

564
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,440
even accomplish their biggest goal,

565
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,679
removing Maduro from power. He

566
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,679
persisted, clinging on to power and

567
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,679
crushed any protests that arose against

568
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,520
him, resulting in the deaths of dozens

569
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,840
to hundreds of protesters since the

570
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,160
contested 2018 election, depending on

571
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,080
the source. And Maduro's isolation from

572
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,080
the US and the Western world led to him

573
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,799
increasing Venezuela's ties with Cuba,

574
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,640
Russia, China, and Iran instead. All of

575
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,039
which helped to buttress his position in

576
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,559
power in various ways. Cuba's

577
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,480
intelligence services began providing

578
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,320
their assistance to him. Russia and Iran

579
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,480
both began providing Venezuela with arms

580
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
to replace the loss in American weapons,

581
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,080
while China began buying up most of what

582
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,160
remained of Venezuela's dwindling oil

583
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,640
exports. All of which essentially made

584
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,400
Venezuela second larger Cuba in the

585
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,000
Western Hemisphere from a geopolitical

586
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
perspective. And on top of the

587
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,840
sanctions, Trump also put the first

588
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
bounty on Maduro during his first term

589
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,080
as well. In 2018, the Trump

590
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,080
administration slapped a $15 million

591
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,600
bounty on Maduro's head based on

592
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,360
accusations that he was personally

593
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,600
directing the operations of the Cartel

594
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
of the Suns along with other highranking

595
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,840
Venezuelan military and political

596
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,679
officials. Allegedly, the US government

597
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,200
accused the cartel of the Suns of

598
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
utilizing the state apparatus of

599
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,120
Venezuela to run a vast cocaine

600
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,120
trafficking project into the United

601
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,120
States, Europe, and elsewhere as an

602
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,600
alternative source of government revenue

603
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,280
in the face of the US imposed sanctions.

604
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
They further accused Maduro and the

605
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,200
cartel of the Sons of collaborating with

606
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,679
the FARC in Colombia to smuggle cocaine

607
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,760
into the United States, an armed Marxist

608
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,360
guerilla rebel force and US designated

609
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,679
terrorist organization with its own

610
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,000
cocaine smuggling operation. Thus, the

611
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,679
US labeled Maduro as a narco terrorist

612
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,520
and charged him with drug trafficking,

613
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,440
moneyaundering, and conspiracy,

614
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,159
regarding him as both an illegitimate

615
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,559
usurper and a wanted fugitive rather

616
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,640
than a sitting president. And then in

617
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,640
between the Trump presidencies, Maduro

618
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
continued doing things that kept pissing

619
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,720
off the US government even further.

620
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,400
Initially, the new Biden administration

621
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,240
attempted to ease Trump's maximum

622
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,559
pressure policy towards Venezuela and

623
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,360
reopen engagement. After Russia invaded

624
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,360
Ukraine in early 2022, Biden agreed to

625
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
allow Chevron to restart a few of its

626
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,960
operations in Venezuela again in order

627
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,360
to help put more oil onto the market and

628
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,200
reduce prices in order to hurt Russia.

629
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,120
Biden also eased some of Trump's

630
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,320
sanctions on Venezuela in exchange for

631
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,840
political promises. In late 2023, Biden

632
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,840
granted the Venezuelans the ability to

633
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,320
begin exporting their oil and gas again

634
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,799
for a period of 6 months in exchange for

635
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,559
Maduro's promise to hold a free and fair

636
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,280
presidential election the following year

637
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,960
in 2024, which the Biden administration

638
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,039
hoped would succeed at removing him from

639
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
power for the maximum pressure strategy

640
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,720
had failed. But almost immediately after

641
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,640
agreeing to host this free and fair

642
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,080
election, Maduro decided to hold a

643
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,400
referendum within the country on whether

644
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,280
or not Venezuela should claim roughly

645
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,120
70% of neighboring Guyana's territory.

646
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,960
Part of a long-standing territorial

647
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,200
dispute that dates back to the colonial

648
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,640
era. This whole situation briefly

649
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,440
captured the world's attention at the

650
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,360
end of 2023 as fears mounted that Maduro

651
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,679
was laying the groundwork for a full-on

652
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,080
invasion of Guyana to claim the disputed

653
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,159
area. If he did so and was successful,

654
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,320
he would also seize control over nearly

655
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,559
all of Guyana's maritime area, and all

656
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,640
of its recently discovered rich offshore

657
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,120
oil reserves that are mostly operated by

658
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,280
Exxon Mobile. Guyana is believed to have

659
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,440
11 billion barrels of oil worth the

660
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,760
reserves offshore, nearly equivalent to

661
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,679
the reserves of OPEC member Algeria. And

662
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,000
because Guyana hasn't been brutally

663
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,919
sanctioned by the US like Venezuela and

664
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,240
generally cooperates with Washington,

665
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,960
Guyana now produces about as much oil as

666
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,440
Venezuela does, despite having vastly

667
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,520
fewer reserves overall. As a result,

668
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,840
Guyana has become a major component of

669
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,840
the global oil and energy map. and most

670
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,600
of its oil exports currently travel to

671
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,760
the US and Europe, helping to keep

672
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,080
Western nation supplies up, keeping oil

673
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,320
prices down with more supply and hurting

674
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Russia and generally benefiting

675
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,400
Washington's overall geopolitical

676
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,159
calculus. A Venezuelan invasion and

677
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,080
seizure of Guyana's territory and oil

678
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,640
fields would never be tolerated by the

679
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,039
US, but Maduro held the referendum for

680
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,320
internal political purposes as well. His

681
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,760
government accused the opposition

682
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,280
leaders in the country of attempting to

683
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,960
sabotage the referendum and issued

684
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,520
arrest warrants for more than a dozen of

685
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,280
them on treason and conspiracy charges,

686
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,120
helping to eliminate many of his most

687
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,080
capable opponents from being able to run

688
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,080
in the 2024 election at all. And so

689
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,080
frustrated, the Biden administration

690
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,960
re-imposed several US sanctions on

691
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,880
Venezuela again in April of 2024, just

692
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,720
ahead of the July presidential election

693
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
in the country, which itself became

694
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,360
marred by controversy, just like the

695
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,039
previous 2018 election had. Both Maduro

696
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,120
and his primary political opposition

697
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,200
candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, claimed

698
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,520
victory in the election. But Maduro

699
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,360
curiously chose not to release any vote

700
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,520
tallies or tabulated results that would

701
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,919
actually prove his victory claim. and

702
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,720
instead he insisted that he narrowly won

703
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,039
the election with just over 51% of the

704
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,799
total. Gonzalez and the opposition

705
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,039
meanwhile claimed that they had actually

706
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,360
won by a landslide and they backed it up

707
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,039
by pretty strong evidence like official

708
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,720
tally sheets that were collected by poll

709
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,799
watchers from a majority of the polling

710
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,520
centers that showed overwhelming support

711
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,640
for Gonzalez. The US along with almost

712
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,320
all of the rest of the Western

713
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,799
Hemisphere, Europe, Australia, New

714
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,720
Zealand, Japan, and South Korea all

715
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,559
refused to recognize the results of the

716
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,919
election and chose to recognize Gonzalez

717
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,080
as the winner in the legitimate

718
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,240
Venezuelan president instead. While

719
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,400
Russia, Belleris, Iran, China, Cuba, and

720
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,320
others chose to support Maduro's claim

721
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,720
and continued recognizing him as the

722
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,880
country's president instead. Anti-Maduro

723
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,880
protests erupted across Venezuela in the

724
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,360
wake of the results, which Maduro used

725
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,520
the army to crush in a massive crackdown

726
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,320
that resulted in more than 2,000 arrests

727
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,679
and more than two dozen deaths. Maduro's

728
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,000
government later issued an arrest

729
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,159
warrant for Gonzalez himself, who fled

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,720
the country in exile for Spain, where he

731
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,720
still remains today, a year later with a

732
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
continued backing and support of the EU

733
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,880
and US to the Venezuelan presidency.

734
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,039
Maduro had unequivocally become a

735
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,279
fullblown dictator in Venezuela who

736
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,600
openly stole elections without any care

737
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,440
of the consequences. Venezuela's score

738
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,679
on the corruption's perceptions index

739
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,240
correspondingly plummeted, falling by

740
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,760
more than 40 places since 2005 to the

741
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,919
point where it's today ranked as the

742
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,000
third most deeply corrupt country on the

743
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,559
earth. Worse off than even countries

744
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,720
like Syria, Eratraa, and North Korea.

745
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,320
Trump's policy of economic warfare and

746
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,760
sanctions during his first term had

747
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
failed to bring about change in the

748
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,279
country and even backfired in the sense

749
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,600
that it contributed to the migration

750
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,200
crisis at the US southern border. While

751
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,039
Biden's policy of engagement and

752
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,360
diplomacy failed to bring about any

753
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,039
change as well, Maduro still remained

754
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,799
throughout at all and if anything was

755
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,960
growing even more authoritarian and

756
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,559
dictatorial, while American influence in

757
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,480
the country was steadily being replaced

758
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,559
by Russian, Chinese, and Iranian

759
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
influence instead, giving many of

760
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,039
America's greatest geopolitical enemies

761
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,320
a foothold in the Western Hemisphere. In

762
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,960
the final days of the Biden

763
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,640
administration in January of 2025, he

764
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,760
had the bounty on Maduro's head

765
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,840
increased from $15 million up to $25

766
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,919
million to increase the pressure

767
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,600
further. And then came the second Trump

768
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,679
administration and another shift in

769
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,279
tactics. Initially, Trump tried to

770
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,360
return back to the economic warfare

771
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,360
policies of his first term by cancelling

772
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,880
Chevron's licenses to do any business in

773
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,720
the country. That decision was

774
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,799
championed by a secretary of state,

775
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,640
Marco Rubio, who has long been an

776
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,640
outspoken hawk on Venezuela within

777
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,480
Washington politics. But it was also

778
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,720
condemned by other parties within

779
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,640
Trump's own MAGA movement, like by big

780
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,400
oil interests and by personalities like

781
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,159
Laura Loomer, who argued that the move

782
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,720
surrendered Venezuela's strategic oil

783
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,240
fields to China. By July, Trump relented

784
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
to the pressure growing within his own

785
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,159
party and allowed Chevron to continue

786
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,840
their operations in Venezuela. While he

787
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,919
attempted to negotiate with Maduro on

788
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,600
his deportation policies involving the

789
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,520
hundreds of thousands of undocumented

790
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,760
Venezuelans residing within the United

791
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,000
States, Trump sent his special envoy,

792
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,080
Richard Grenel, directly to Venezuela to

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,400
meet with Maduro in person. They agreed

794
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,480
that in exchange for a reduction in some

795
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,080
sanctions, Venezuela would release some

796
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,919
American hostages and they would begin

797
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,080
accepting deportation flights of their

798
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,000
citizens from the United States. Through

799
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,159
the month of July alone, the US

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
government sent nine deportation flights

801
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,559
to Venezuela. a sign of how close

802
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,279
Washington and Caracus were cooperating

803
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,600
together fairly recently. However, Trump

804
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,600
was also aware of three things. His own

805
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,360
policy of sanctions and isolation to try

806
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,600
and remove Maduro from power during his

807
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,200
first term had failed. Biden's policy of

808
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,279
diplomacy and engagement had failed to

809
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,200
remove Maduro from power as well. and

810
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,520
further diplomacy and engagement on his

811
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,600
part was deeply unpopular with large

812
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,200
segments of his own voter base,

813
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
especially among the Cuban exile

814
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,440
community in South Florida and his own

815
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,039
secretary of state, Marco Rubio. Trump

816
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,120
has likely calculated that another

817
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,960
tactic to remove Maduro from power or to

818
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,960
force him into compliance was needed

819
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,600
without escalating all the way to

820
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,279
full-blown war. and thus why he has

821
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,760
likely decided to resort to a bout of

822
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,760
gunboat diplomacy now with a secret

823
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,679
directive authorizing the US military to

824
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,760
attack cartels that he's designated as

825
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,600
terrorist organizations his doubling of

826
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,000
the bounty on Maduro's head to $50

827
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,760
million and is surrounding Venezuela's

828
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
territorial waters with warships and

829
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
submarines not to even mention the

830
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,080
blowing up of the alleged trenda boat

831
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,000
out in international waters Trump is

832
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,559
attempting to apply even more pressure

833
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,559
on Maduro than anyone else has ever done

834
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
before getting rid of Maduro the country

835
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,240
and replacing it with a more friendly

836
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
regime would do several things for US

837
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,840
interests. First, if it is to be

838
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,840
believed that the cartel of the sons

839
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
actually exists and Maduro is indeed

840
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,919
using the powers of the Venezuelan state

841
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,000
to align with Trenaragua and other

842
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,919
cartels to smuggle cocaine and fentinyl

843
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,679
into the United States, toppling him

844
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,279
from power would curb a significant

845
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,279
source of drugs entering into the

846
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,640
country. Secondly, removing Maduro from

847
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,480
power and replacing him with someone

848
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,080
more friendly to Western interests would

849
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,399
remove the Venezuelan territorial threat

850
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
to Guyana and all of its oil fields.

851
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,840
While it would also help to restart

852
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,919
Western oil company's activities within

853
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,320
Venezuela itself, which after a few

854
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,320
years time of fixing could help get

855
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,159
massive amounts of Venezuelan oil back

856
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,159
onto the world market again after

857
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,159
decades of absence and neglect, which

858
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,320
would further reduce global oil prices

859
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,840
and help ease inflation and herd

860
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,760
Russia's economy and its warfighting

861
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,760
ability in Ukraine and elsewhere.

862
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,120
Finally, removing Maduro from power

863
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,600
would remove a growing base of

864
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,520
operations for major US adversaries in

865
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,200
the Western Hemisphere. Russia has

866
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,279
announced plans to begin constructing a

867
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,120
major ammunition factory in Venezuela

868
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,960
and has sold billions of dollars worth

869
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,480
of arms to the country and has been

870
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
rumored to be considering installing

871
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,559
archnic hypersonic nuclearcapable

872
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,399
missiles on Venezuelan territory as

873
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,640
well, though that so far has been

874
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,159
unsubstantiated. Meanwhile, there's also

875
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,919
been a significant amount of military

876
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,919
cooperation going on between Venezuela

877
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,159
and Iran as well, built upon their

878
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,240
mutual opposition towards the US.

879
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
Venezuela has allegedly enabled itself

880
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,080
to be used as a point of entry for

881
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,000
Hezbollah into the greater Latin America

882
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,919
region and the two are known to have

883
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,880
collaborated on drone technology for

884
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,440
years now. Just last year in 2024,

885
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,679
Venezuela unveiled a new kamicazi drone

886
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,399
that they call the Zamora V1, which is

887
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,399
based on the same well-known Shahed 136

888
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,880
drone that has been used extensively by

889
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,360
the Russian army in Ukraine. So far, the

890
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,000
Zamora V1 is much more primitive than

891
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,600
the Shahed 136 is with a much shorter

892
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,520
range and a much smaller explosive

893
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,679
payload. But if the Venezuelans ever

894
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,279
managed to get it up to par with further

895
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,840
help from the Iranians, they could

896
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,919
conceivably eventually use the drones in

897
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,760
swarms to attack strategic targets as

898
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,840
far away as Florida and the Panama

899
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,600
Canal, which is probably a capability

900
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,000
that the United States would not like an

901
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,760
adversary like Venezuela to possess.

902
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,440
With all of that being said, however,

903
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,840
the number of military assets that Trump

904
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,919
has so far deployed around Venezuela are

905
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,760
not enough for a full-blown invasion

906
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,679
into the country. But that's probably

907
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,240
not what Trump is actually wanting to do

908
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,159
anyway. It is still the largest overseas

909
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,399
deployment of US military assets in the

910
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,640
Western Hemisphere since the 1989

911
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,440
invasion of Panama. But Venezuela in

912
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,399
2025 is not the same thing as Panama in

913
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,320
1989. Back then, the US had similarly

914
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,559
indicted Panama's dictator, Manuel

915
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,080
Noriega, on federal drug trafficking

916
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,520
charges and decided to invade the

917
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,600
country in order to remove and arrest

918
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,399
him. But that operation involved nearly

919
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,320
30,000 US troops, many of whom were

920
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,240
already stationed directly in Panama

921
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
near the Panama Canal Zone back when it

922
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,080
still existed. And Panama was a much

923
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,640
smaller country with a much smaller

924
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,679
population than Venezuela has today.

925
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,520
Only 4,500 US troops have so far been

926
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,919
positioned around Venezuela aboard their

927
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,760
ships. Far too few to actually invade

928
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,840
the country, remove Maduro from power,

929
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,919
and occupy it. But that isn't to say

930
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,240
that they can't still help remove Maduro

931
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,919
from power anyway. Trump is likely

932
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,320
betting that following the hotly

933
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,240
disputed 2024 election and protest in

934
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,640
the country, the Maduro is presently

935
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,039
deeply unpopular with his own people.

936
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,960
The $50 million bounty on his head and

937
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,279
the tens of millions of dollars on his

938
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
crony's heads along with the presence of

939
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,080
all the US warships gathered just

940
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,000
offshore might just tempt someone to

941
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,159
launch a rebellion with the expectation

942
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,159
that the US warships and air power will

943
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,919
give assistance to them. Giving the US

944
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,440
the ground forces that it needs without

945
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,279
having to commit any of their own.

946
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,799
Similar to how NATO air power helped

947
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,519
Libyan rebels on the ground topple

948
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,880
Muamar Gaddafi's regime in 2011. If a

949
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,279
similar series of events were to

950
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,039
transpire in Venezuela, the US also

951
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,720
already has the man in waiting that they

952
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,679
would want to replace Madura with.

953
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,440
Edmundo Gonzalez still in exile in Spain

954
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,440
whom Washington still recognizes as

955
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,880
Venezuela's legitimate president. The

956
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,720
tomahawk missiles on board the

957
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,880
destroyers, cruiser, and submarine along

958
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,960
with the F-35s known to be deployed to

959
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,640
Puerto Rico enables the United States to

960
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,480
decide on surgical aerial strikes

961
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,080
against Maduro's most critical assets

962
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,080
and infrastructure. They could choose to

963
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,840
attack narcotic sites or even elements

964
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,679
of the state like military and command

965
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,600
sites or even Venezuela's remaining

966
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,279
operational oil production and refinery

967
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,600
sites. They could even resort to

968
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,679
attempted decapitation strikes targeting

969
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Maduro himself and/or his senior

970
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,200
generals and officers. The Marine

971
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,799
Expeditionary Unit, while not large

972
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,720
enough to assault the beaches and march

973
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,880
all the way to Caracus and arrest Maduro

974
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,039
alone, could also be utilized in a more

975
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,399
limited raid under extensive aerial

976
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,480
cover to attempt an arrest and

977
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,039
extraction of Maduro under certain

978
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,440
circumstances. Like in the event of a

979
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,120
major rebellion and its associated chaos

980
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,200
in the country, doing something like

981
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,120
this would be far from unprecedented for

982
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,440
Trump and would in fact represent his

983
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,440
preferred way of deploying US military

984
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,120
power. During his first administration,

985
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,960
he ordered Tomahawk missile strikes

986
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,360
against the Assad regime in Syria in

987
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,440
2017. He ordered a special forces raid

988
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,919
in Syria in 2019 that killed the leader

989
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,000
of ISIS. And it's recently come to light

990
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,240
that he also authorized a failed Navy

991
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,720
Seal raid into North Korea that resulted

992
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,120
in three killed North Korean civilians.

993
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,120
In 2020, he authorized a drone strike in

994
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,200
Iraq that assassinated Iran's most

995
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,679
senior military commander. And already

996
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,600
in 2025, he's launched a sea and air

997
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,679
campaign against the Houthis in Yemen

998
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,360
and ordered a B2 bomber raid on Iran

999
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,000
that blew up Iran's most critical

1000
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,320
nuclear research sites. Trump doesn't

1001
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,480
like getting involved in big land wars.

1002
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,720
But he does like employing surgical air

1003
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,799
strikes and raids. And the forces he has

1004
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,799
gathered just outside of Venezuela could

1005
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,799
fit this pattern of his with limited

1006
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,120
strikes against the Maduro regime itself

1007
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,119
or against Trenaragua and other cartel

1008
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,720
targets. To give you an idea of the

1009
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,320
current capabilities of the Venezuelan

1010
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,480
military, consider the fate of the

1011
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,159
Venezuelan Navy's patrol boat, Neuada,

1012
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,079
in 2020. While operating in

1013
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,599
international waters, the Neuada

1014
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,679
attempted to intercept a cruise ship

1015
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,520
called the RCGS Resolute. The

1016
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,119
Venezuelans fired warning shots and

1017
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,879
ordered the Resolute to follow them to a

1018
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,560
port in Venezuela before they then

1019
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,560
collided their ship with the Resolute

1020
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,399
and sank themselves without anybody on

1021
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,240
the Resolute ever doing anything at all.

1022
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,079
Maduro himself then denounced the

1023
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,839
captain of the Resolute as a pirate and

1024
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,520
a terrorist. While the Venezuelan

1025
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,599
defense minister described what happened

1026
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,599
as an act of imperial aggression on the

1027
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,839
part of the Resolute, a cruise ship.

1028
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,440
Venezuela has some fighter jets, tanks,

1029
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,599
warships, and submarines and their

1030
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,040
Iranian assisted drones. But the

1031
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,800
sanctions that have been levied upon

1032
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,639
them for years have prevented them from

1033
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,399
acquiring spare parts and performing

1034
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,079
routine maintenance on a lot of them.

1035
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,320
And while Venezuela is known to have the

1036
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,240
Russian-p produced S300 anti-air system

1037
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,480
that dates back from the 2000s, it's

1038
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,079
likely that America's more modern F-35

1039
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,160
fighters that are currently in Puerto

1040
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,079
Rico could evade their detection. While

1041
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,560
the S300's would also struggle against

1042
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,160
the Tomahawk cruise missiles as well. If

1043
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,760
Trump gives the order for the flotilla

1044
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,000
to begin launching aerial attacks at

1045
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,599
targets within Venezuela itself rather

1046
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,359
than just limiting them to drug runners

1047
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
out in international waters, there's

1048
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,040
likely little the Maduro could

1049
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,640
realistically do to actually stop them.

1050
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Whether that results in a rebellion or

1051
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,040
Maduro's removal from power, however, is

1052
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,040
a different thing entirely. There were

1053
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,800
great hopes within Israel and the United

1054
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,960
States that the aerial bombing campaign

1055
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,640
launched against Iran earlier this year

1056
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,960
would have led to a rebellion that would

1057
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,720
topple the Iranian regime as well. But

1058
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,800
that never ended up materializing. And

1059
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,200
if anything, foreign bombs falling on

1060
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,520
Iranian soil only solidify the regime's

1061
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,359
authority with its people. There is no

1062
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,960
guarantee that attacks on Venezuela

1063
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,560
would do anything different. And then

1064
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
even if it does end up working out as

1065
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,160
intended and Maduro does end up getting

1066
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,160
removed, there's no guarantee of what

1067
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,320
the ensuing chaos in Venezuela could

1068
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,560
produce. Tobling Gaddafi in Libya and

1069
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,640
Saddam in Iraq both led to decades of

1070
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,560
chaos in those countries. And armed

1071
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,040
non-state actors in Colombia like the

1072
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,359
ELN, who have extensive influence in

1073
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,960
Venezuela, could capitalize on the chaos

1074
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,760
produced in unpredictable and

1075
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,440
potentially undesirable ways. Venezuela

1076
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,119
could end up developing into a situation

1077
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,960
like a in neighboring Colombia, which

1078
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,880
has been experiencing a constant

1079
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,960
low-level conflict between various

1080
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,200
non-state militias and armed groups for

1081
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,040
the past half century now.

1082
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,560
Interestingly, just before I release

1083
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,320
this video, the Venezuelan government

1084
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,079
began accusing the US of conducting

1085
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,160
intelligence flights over the Caribbean

1086
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,160
region against them. Venezuela's defense

1087
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,240
minister, who has that active $15

1088
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,240
million bounty on his head issued by the

1089
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,440
US government, stated that American

1090
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,280
intelligence and reconnaissance

1091
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,520
operations, including spy flights

1092
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,599
against Venezuela, had tripled across

1093
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,280
the month of August. This led to the

1094
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,359
defense minister claiming that the US

1095
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,119
was seeking a justification for an armed

1096
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,839
intervention in Venezuela to remove

1097
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,680
Maduro from power. And since then, one

1098
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,680
of the US Navy warships reportedly

1099
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,920
raided a Venezuelan fishing boat within

1100
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,760
Venezuela's own waters. the first

1101
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,359
apparent search and seizure operation by

1102
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,520
the Navy Force that's gathered in the

1103
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,040
region. I've been a longtime user of

1104
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,680
Ground News and I've partnered with them

1105
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,440
since 2022 because it's a product I

1106
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,280
trust to give me the information I need

1107
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,760
to better understand how a story is

1108
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,680
being framed and the context behind it.

1109
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,280
Ground News is an app and website on a

1110
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,760
mission to give us the transparency

1111
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,920
we're looking for in the news. It pulls

1112
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,560
in thousands of articles every day from

1113
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,160
all around the world into one place to

1114
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,320
show us how the different outlets cover

1115
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,079
the same story. So for each story, you

1116
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
get a visual breakdown of each outlet's

1117
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,119
bias, its reliability, and who owns the

1118
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,520
source. Let me show you how it works. On

1119
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,040
ground news, you can see that over 250

1120
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,640
news outlets are covering this story

1121
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,800
with the majority leaning left and

1122
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,560
center. And if I scroll down, I can see

1123
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,560
every outlet that's reported on the

1124
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,920
story. Venezuela and left-leaning

1125
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,760
sources have called the seizure of the

1126
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,680
fishing boat illegal and have described

1127
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,839
it as a hostile raid that violated

1128
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,599
Venezuela's national sovereignty, while

1129
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,760
the US government and right-leaning

1130
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,480
sources have stressed it as a necessary

1131
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,720
action of US anti-drug enforcement and a

1132
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,119
justified seizure within a law and order

1133
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,960
context. This story was also a blind

1134
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,280
spot for people who read right-leaning

1135
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,280
sources. Ground News has an entire

1136
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,720
feature they call the blind spot feed to

1137
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,520
make sure you don't miss out on any

1138
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,760
stories that are being

1139
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,359
disproportionately reported by either

1140
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,160
side of the political spectrum, like

1141
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,079
this one we just saw. I use ground news

1142
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,880
daily and as a critical research tool

1143
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,880
for my videos. I find it crucial in

1144
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,640
today's increasingly polarized media

1145
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,040
environment. And as viewers of my

1146
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,880
channel, I think you'd find it extremely

1147
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,200
valuable, too. Which is why I've

1148
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,200
partnered with Crown News to get you 40%

1149
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,119
