      "cluster_summary": "Simon Whistler traces Venezuela's economic history, beginning with the 1922 discovery of massive oil reserves in the Maracaibo Basin and the subsequent 1943 law that enriched military rulers. While these resources initially brought immense wealth, the government's heavy reliance on \"black gold\" and failure to diversify the economy created a vulnerable, lopsided system. This historical analysis highlights how oil mania and poor leadership decisions ultimately set the stage for the country's long-term instability and political shifts.",
